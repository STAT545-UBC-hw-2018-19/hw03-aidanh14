# Homework 03: Use dplyr/ggplot2 to manipulate and explore data

We were given a list of tasks to choose three from and complete. Here are my choices:

* *"How is life expectancy changing over time on different continents?"*

* *"Task 2"*

* *"Task 3"*


Don't forget to include our packages:

```{r packages}
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library("gapminder"))
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library("tidyverse"))
```



## "How is life expectancy changing over time on different continents?"

```{r lifeExp each year}
gapminder %>%
  select(year, continent, lifeExp) %>%
  group_by(year) %>%
  mutate(meanLifeExp = mean(lifeExp)) %>%
  arrange(year)

```
